# Star-Classifier
An expansion on the previous project of Star Analytics. Looking into what method can best classify the type of star, while measuring the difference between them and the original set, utilizing both k-fold and LOOCV.

## Project Overview

In this AI/ML project I explored and expanded upon the previous projects nuances of Star Type Classification. Through multiple methods such as Logistic Regression, K-NN, Random Forrest Generation, and SVM, I attempt to see which model would best result in the most accurate star classification. Through the process of engineering artificial noise and bootstrapping, I attempted to remedy the overfitting due to the constraints of the dataset. These proved to only highlight further the limitations of the dataset and a thorough glare of this was seen when they were combined.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Star Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains physical properties of stars including:

- Temperature (Kelvin)
- Luminosity (relative to the Sun)
- Radius (relative to the Sun)
- Absolute magnitude
- Star type and color

**Dataset link (CC0 / public):** 
You may view the dataset here: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset?resource=download).

The dataset is small, clean, and ideal for exploratory analysis and unsupervised learning.
